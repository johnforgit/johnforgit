### My journey so far
My journey into the fascinating world of computers began in my school where I chose cs as the elective subject. From there on it was all a matter of how to program stuff in each and every way possible. My first programming language was Python and I still use it for most of my programming interests. However over the course of time I also learnt more about other programming languages. Some where a necessity while others were pursued for pure leisure. I enjoy reading books and listening to music. I also swim and play basketball. I'm also an amateur marathon runner. My journey so far has been through valleys and hills and it has been nothing short of amazing. I believe learning new things and moving forward is the way to go
